        It seems reasonable to presume this doctor would test negative at this point. He reported that he was self-quarantining approx 8/5/2014, and there have been no reports of complications about him yet. With a 21-day incubation period, he should be either sick, or totally in the clear by 8/31. Presumably if he gets sick, it would be global news.
