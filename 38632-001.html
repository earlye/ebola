<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  I've been following the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa since
  the first reports of it in March. Ebola has held a harrowing place
  in my heart since I read

  by Richard Preston, years ago. Any time I hear of an outbreak, I pay
  close attention, because of Ebola's potential to be horribly
  destructive on a global scale.
</p>

<p>
  So far - even with the current record-breaking outbreak - that
  potential has thankfully gone wholly unfulfilled. Ebola is
  usually <i>so</i> deadly that it "burns itself out" before it has a
  chance to really wreak havoc. Person "A" gets it, maybe transmits it
  to person "B", and then they're both dead within a day or two and it
  doesn't spread any further. Morbidly, Ebola's biggest weakness has
  been its terrifying deadliness.
</p>

<p>
  This outbreak is different, though; some 13,000 people have caught
  it, and 6,000 of those have died. Each individual who gets Ebola in
  Africa, during this outbreak, spreads it to between

    1.51 and 2.53
  </a>
  others, on average. What do these numbers mean?  I put together a
  very simplified

  of those values. Let's just say that I wish my stock portfolio would
  grow at these rates.

</p>

<p>
  There is a reason the World Health Organization is predicting 10,000
  new infections per week in December, and some headlines are
  predicting hundreds of thousands, possibly millions infected in the
  new year. The outbreak in Africa is right around the bend in this
  curve between week 20 and week 25. Without effective intervention,
  things could get really bad, indeed.
</p>

<p>
  But why is this outbreak different? There are a number of reasons, and
  some of them include lessons for us to consider as we face the
  prospect of fighting Ebola on our own shores:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The most painfully affected countries have recently gone through
    periods of civil war, so their healthcare systems are in shambles.
  </li>

  <li>
    There is a local custom in West Africa of bathing the corpse of
    loved ones. This is a group affair, and involves hugging the
    corpse, washing it, etc., without any protective gear. This
    practice is thought to have contributed greatly to Ebola's
    devastating effects in West Africa.
  </li>

  <li>
    In West Africa, superstition trumps science for many people. As a
    result, during this outbreak, there have been a number of
    incidents where mobs would "rescue" Ebola patients, would
    threaten, attack, or outright murder healthcare workers, or spread
    rumors that Ebola is a hoax.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How accurate is the "Party Line?"</h2>

<p>
  Unless you've been totally ignoring the news for the past few
  months, you've probably heard the standard statements about Ebola:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days
  </li>
  <li>
    Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infectious person.
  </li>
  <li>
    Somebody who is infected with Ebola, but is not showing symptoms, is NOT contagious.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ebola is up to 90% fatal
  </li>
  <li>
    Ebola is not airborne
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  I wondered: what does the science <i>really</i> say about these
  statements? How accurate are they? Is there evidence to suggest any
  of them is untrue? After all, if <a href='http://xkcd.com/882/'>this
    web comic</a> says that scientific reporting is suspect, maybe
  that's the case for Ebola reporting, too. So I dug in a little
  bit. Here's what I found.
</p>

<ol>

  <li><strong>Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days.</strong>
    <p>
      Well... maybe.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ... for outbreaks of Ebola Zaire HF they have varied from 3-12 days. Overall, these reports indicate a range of 3-13 days for the incubation period.
      <a style='vertical-align:super' href='http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_3/S810.full'>[Kortepeter, et al.]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The source here is a summary of Ebola cases as of 2011, which was kind enough to include references to the
      source material. Where this material was not pay-walled, I followed the links and read the original reports.
      Unfortunately, the information for incubation period is a little bit sketchy, though for good reason; you
      can't go inoculate people with Ebola to observe the incubation period.  Therefore, to determine what the
      incubation period is, you must interview patients to figure out when their exposure was, and hope the interviews
      are accurate.  In one of the papers cited by Kortepeter et al, it appears that less than 5% of cases
      could be investigated with enough precision to determine when their exposure was:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The incubation period could be determined with precision
      for only 5 patients, all of whom were health care workers (2
      died and 3 survived). These 5 patients had had direct contact
      with patients (no needlestick incidents) during a maximum of
      1 day; they became ill a mean of 6.2 days (range, 5 - 8) after
      the contact.
      <a style='vertical-align:super' href='http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S1.full.pdf+html'>[Bwaka et al]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The Bwaka paper describes an outbreak in 1995 often referred to as the Kikwit outbreak,
      because it took place in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The paper covers
      103 patients, yet only 5 patients could have their incubation periods reliably determined.
      Given the uncertainty associated with these numbers, as well as the lethality of the disease,
      tripling the roughly one week observed period seems a prudent safety factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there's at least one paper that suggests even 21 days is not conservative enough - there
      was at least one case of a (suspected) 25 day incubation period:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The maximum incubation period, defined as the median duration of the interval from the onset
      of fever in the primary case to the onset of fever in the first secondary case, was
      17 days (range, 9 - 25).
      <a style='vertical-align:super' href='http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S87.full'>[Dowel et al]</a>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infectious person.</strong>
    <p>
      One of the things that has disturbed me during this outbreak is the conflicting information we're
      getting from news sources.
      On the one hand, politicians are quick to remind us that you have to have close, direct, contact with
      an infectious person. On the other, we have articles like
      <a href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/motorcycling-to-ebola-treatment-could-spread-the-infection1/'>this</a>
      from Scientific American, which weave tales like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ambulances are scarce in areas of west Africa roiled by the Ebola outbreak, so when ill patients and
      their families need to go to the clinic they often turn to the next best thing&dash;a motorcycle taxi. An
      ill passenger will wrap her arms around the driver's waist and away they will go&dash;sometimes driving an
      hour or so to get to a nearby clinic. During the journey a weak patient, clinging to the driver, may
      expel diarrhea and literally drape herself over the driver even as her bodily fluids permeate the seat.
      In the process the driver may get infected.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to be the next person on that motorcycle taxi, regardless
      of whether Ebola is transmissible that way. The CDC's take is this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ebola on dry surfaces, such as doorknobs and countertops, can survive for several hours; however,
      virus in body fluids (such as blood) can survive up to several days at room temperature.
      <a style='vertical-align:super' href='http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas.html'>Q&As on Transmission</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, that page on the CDC's website doesn't maintain links to source studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what do actual researchers say? Well, trying to find papers on that sort of depends on figuring out
      the requisite clinical terminology. If you try, as I did, searching for "ebola out of body," you'll come
      up with a bunch of hokum about out-of-body experiences. The correct term to use is "fomite," which is
      <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=define+fomite'>defined</a> as any object which can transfer germs
      from one host to another. So a contaminated needle is a fomite, as would be a contaminated motorcycle seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use Google Scholar to <a href='http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=ebola+transmission+fomite'>search</a>
      for "Ebola transmission fomite," you can find about 1100 articles. Obviously I didn't go through all of them -
      (I do have a day job after all...) but here are some of the interesting studies I did find.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/196/Supplement_2/S142.long">Bausch, et al</a> - Tested
        surfaces in a hospital isolation-ward setting, where floors were sprayed with bleach each morning, and other
        surfaces on an "as-needed" basis. The good news here is that this found that "environmental contamination
        and fomites do not appear to pose a significant risk when currently recommended infection control guidelines
        for the viral hemorrhagic fevers are followed." This seems to contradict the experience we've seen in West Africa
        and in Dallas, where healthcare workers have taken the brunt of this illness particularly hard. In Dallas, though,
        the nurses were apparently sent in without significant training on those guidelines, and in West Africa,
        there was no real healthcare system to speak of, and video of their isolation wards suggests they've had
        a difficult time implementing those guidelines, too.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/179/Supplement_1/S87.full">Dowell, et al</a> - A field study
        where they checked in Kikwit to see how close contacts (family members living with a patient) fared, and
        worked backwards from this to identify risk factors. Among the patients in the study, 95% died. This
        study offers the strongest evidence I've found that the claim is true that direct physical contact is required
        to transmit Ebola.
        <blockquote>
          Of 95 family members who had such contact, 28 became infected, whereas none of 78 family members who did not
          touch an infected person during the period of clinical illness were infected.
        </blockquote>
        One paragraph from this study should be comforting to parents.
        <blockquote>
          Children were relatively spared in this outbreak [Kikwit], as has been typical for the previous EBO
          outbreaks and for certain other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Only 27 (9%) of the 315 persons in Kikwit
          who developed EHF were <17 years of age, and in this study, adult household contacts were at considerably
                                     increased risk compared with children. Much of this risk was related to more frequent exposure of the adults
                                     to ill family members and their body fluids, but elevated risk for adults remained even after adjusting
                                     for their increased exposures. Thus it remains possible that in addition to being less likely to be exposed
                                     to EBO, children are less susceptible to infection or severe disease. This question requires further study.
                                     </blockquote>

        Another field study looking at the Uganda outbreak from August 2000 through January 2001. This is
        the only paper I was able to find which discussed correlations between specific modes of fomite
        transmission.
        <blockquote>
          Regarding indirect transmission, sleeping on the same mat (PPR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.70),
          participating in the ritual handwashing during the funeral ceremony (PPR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.08 to
          4.72), and sharing a communal meal during the funeral ceremony (PPR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.35 to 5.98)
          were significantly associated with disease. Although the differences were not statistically
          significant, sharing meals, washing clothes, and sleeping in the same hut were associated with
          a higher risk of acquiring the disease.
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Somebody who is infected with Ebola, but is not showing symptoms, is NOT contagious.</strong>
    <p>
      This is perhaps the most troubling assertion I see in the
      mainstream, for several reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>
          None of the papers I read talked about the basis of this
          claim - and instead simply report it as gospel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other diseases are reportedly contagious during the
          incubation period. (The Flu is contagious from 1 day before
          symptoms appear to 5-7 days after - longer for children according
          to the
          <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm'>CDC</a>
          )
        </li>
        <li>
          Several of the papers I read discussed patients who
          had gotten sick with no known exposure. It seems extremely
          unlikely that Ebola would spring into existence inside an
          individual without an actual exposure, and much more likely
          that although we do not know when or how those patients were
          exposed, an exposure did happen. Was this exposure to an
          asymptomatic patient? By definition, we don't know.
        </li>
        <li>
          The belief that Ebola is not spread during the incubation
          period seems to rest on the idea that since Ebola is spread
          via bodily fluids, it can only be spread once the virus
          spreads from the point of initial infection into the
          patient's blood stream (this is called viremia). However,
          multiple papers refer to the practice of sharing meals, and
          specifically the practice of eating finger-lickin' food from
          a communal plate, as being high risk. Presumably these are
          high risk because virus from an index patient's mouth is
          transferred to the food on the plate, and then to other
          people. In other words, there seems to be evidence that
          saliva is one of the bodily fluids which communicates
          Ebola. I found no studies testing Ebola in saliva in the
          period before viremia.

          show that in various outbreaks, people became infected with
          Ebola, but
          <em>never showed symptoms.</em>  The presence of Ebola in
          these people was determined by blood tests. So how do we
          know that such fortunate people cannot transmit Ebola, like
          Typhoid Mary? Again, I found no studies discussing this
          question by way of numbers.
          <p>
            The most reassuring discussion of this question in any of
            the papers was this frankly-written paragraph:
            <blockquote>
              If symptomless Ebola carriage posed a significant risk
              of infection, evidence of sporadic cases of haemorrhagic
              fever associated with, but not directly linked to, major
              outbreaks of Ebola infection should be identifiable by
              standard epidemiological techniques. Unfortunately,
              social and political conditions in central Africa
              seriously impede contact tracing. However, within these
              limitations, transmission of Ebola has been observed to
              occur only after close personal contact with affected
              patients or by exposure to infected body fluids or
              organs. Every outbreak of Ebola to date has been
              contained by the institution of standard
              infection-control measures: effective body disposal,
              barrier nursing, destruction or sterilisation of
              contaminated equipment, and the appropriate use of
              gloves, masks, and gowns.7 This degree of containment
              would be virtually impossible if symptom-free carriers
              posed a significant threat of infection.

          On the other hand, Dr Bruce Beutler, the nobel-prize winning
          director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at
          UT Southwestern Medical Center, had this to say on the topic
          <blockquote>
            “It may not be absolutely true that those without symptoms
            can’t transmit the disease, because we don’t have the
            numbers to back that up,” said Beutler, “It could be
            people develop significant viremia [where viruses enter
            the bloodstream and gain access to the rest of the body],
            and become able to transmit the disease before they have a
            fever, even. People may have said that without symptoms
            you can’t transmit Ebola. I’m not sure about that being
            100 percent true. There’s a lot of variation with
            viruses.”

          </blockquote>
          And if you think about it, this makes sense.  Testing for Ebola
          in the blood stream is expensive, so nobody goes around testing
          people unless they already have symptoms. So we don't know
          what their blood looked like the day <em>before</em> they
          became symptomatic.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I side with Dr Beutler, and do not trust this
      assertion.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Ebola is up to 90% fatal</strong>
    <p>
      Well, that's pretty scary, isn't it? Notice that "up to" bit, though? It actually should say
      up to 100% fatal, because in a 2011 outbreak, precisely <em>one</em> person got sick, and that
      person died.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, especially given the level of success being experienced at US hospitals, that
      the quality of care given to a patient can have a dramatic effect on the outcome.  So far, 1
      person has died in the US of Ebola, while 7 people have been treated here. That works out
      to only a 14% fatality rate. Those still aren't odds I'd want to take, but it's not quite
      as terrifying as the 90% number that usually ends up in headlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what are the actual numbers? Fortunately, the CDC has a convenient table we can
      look at which outlines all known Ebola outbreaks
      <a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/history/chronology.html'>
        here
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I copied the CDC data to a
      <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ngFt7_Pxp-Xoig1PnNv9Le7l0gKYE_6h9RsjH0Unmt4/edit?usp=sharing'>
        Google Spreadsheet
      </a>
      so that I could toy around with the numbers some. What I find is that the average lethality
      is around 57%. I was also able to put together some charts that I find interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chart compares the number of cases in a given outbreak with the lethality during that
      outbreak. I don't see a particularly strong correlation between the two, though I do
      find it interesting that the two most broadly-spread outbreaks had fatality rates closer to
      50% than to 100%.<br/>

      </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      This chart shows fatality rate over time. Again, there's no correlation, but it's interesting
      to zoom around and see the magnitudes involved in various outbreaks.

  <li><strong>Ebola is not airborne</strong>
    <p>
      That's a reassuring thing to hear. I don't know about you, but
      if something is 57% fatal <strong>(or, as the headlines spew, UP
        TO 90% FATAL!!!)</strong>, I don't want to risk getting it just
      by walking outside. If something that fatal were airborne in the
      way the flu is &dash; or, God forbid, a strain of flu emerged
      which <em>was</em> that deadly &dash; it would be time to
      consider making a fashion statement by wearing a HEPA-filtered
      hood at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it really not airborne? What's the science say?

        <blockquote>
          The absence of illness among persons who were exposed to
          cases in confined spaces, but without physical contact,
          confirmed previous impressions that there is no risk of
          airborne transmission.

        <blockquote>
          Ebola is rarely transmitted via an airborne route.
        </blockquote>
        This paper goes on to discuss that because it is rare for
        Ebola to be transmitted by an airborne route, respiratory
        protection is unnecessary, and should not be used, because
        <blockquote>
          the image of workers with spectacular protective clothing might
          contribute to the panic in some communities. If this leads
          people to flee affected areas it could increase the spread of
          infection. It also reinforces the view that some lives are
          more valuable than others, already engendered by decisions
          about the use of experimental Ebola drug ZMapp.
        </blockquote>
        I would argue that this is an argument that we should innovate
        to produce less expensive resperatory protection gear so that
        it becomes commonplace, and that we should educate so that
        people understand it is precautionary and meant to ensure not only
        that the healthcare worker doesn't get sick, but that the
        worker doesn't spread the disease, either.

        This experiment involved aersolizing ebola virus and exposing
        4 rhesus monkeys to the resulting aerosol, while refraining
        from giving exposure to 2 control monkeys.
        <blockquote>
          The potential of aerogenic infection by Ebola virus was
          established by using a head-only exposure aerosol
          system. &hellip; Clinical disease occurred in all four Ebola
          virus exposed monkeys, but not in either of the control
          monkeys.
        </blockquote>
        In other words, you can probably get Ebola by inhaling it,
        because monkeys definitely can. This seems to contradict the
        prior two papers. I think this can be reconciled by
        hypothesizing that Ebola virus does not tend to shed through
        the lungs and therefore does not get aerosolized in nature. So
        even though the nose, mouth and lungs are capable of being
        airborne infection sites, they do not appear to produce virus
        in an aerosolized manner.

          Weingartl, et al.
        </a>
        This experiment involved innoculating six pigs, and
        subsequently putting them in cages in the vicinity of, but
        without direct contact to, six monkeys. The six monkeys
        got sick:
        <blockquote>
          Here we show ZEBOV transmission from pigs to cynomolgus
          macaques without direct contact. Interestingly, transmission
          between macaques in similar housing conditions was never
          observed. Piglets inoculated oro-nasally with ZEBOV were
          transferred to the room housing macaques in an open
          inaccessible cage system. All macaques became
          infected. Infectious virus was detected in oro-nasal swabs
          of piglets, and in blood, swabs, and tissues of
          macaques. This is the first report of experimental
          interspecies virus transmission, with the macaques also used
          as a human surrogate.<br/>

          &hellip;

          Under conditions of the current study, transmission of ZEBOV
          could have occurred either by inhalation (of aerosol or
          larger droplets), and/or droplet inoculation of eyes and
          mucosal surfaces and/or by fomites due to droplets generated
          during the cleaning of the room. Infection of all four
          macaques in an environment, preventing direct contact
          between the two species and between the macaques themselves,
          supports the concept of airborne transmission.

          It is of interest, that the first macaques to become
          infected were housed in cages located directly within the
          main airflow to the air exhaust system.  The experimental
          setting of the present study could not quantify the relative
          contribution of aerosol, small and large droplets in the
          air, and droplets landing inside the NHP cages (fomites) to
          EBOV transmission between pigs and macaques. These
          parameters will need to be investigated using an
          experimental approach specifically designed to address this
          question.

    <p>
      In summary, I think it is possible to transmit Ebola via an
      airborne route (by cough or sneeze droplets), I agree that it is
      not transmitted from humans in an aerosolized manner. If it
      were, I think it would be much more contagious and we would see
      much faster and deadlier spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I believe it is possible to transmit Ebola via airborne
      routes, I wholeheartedly disagree with Martin-Morena, and think
      healthcare workers should absolutely wear respiratory protection.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  Here's how I rank my confidence in the 5 statements that I set out
  to investigate:

  <ol>
    <li><strong>80%</strong> - Ebola has an incubation period of up to
      21 days <i>There have been cases where it might have been as much
        as 25 days. It seems like it's usually only around 6 or 7 days
        though, so the odds are that 21 is still on the conservative
        side</i>
    </li>

    <li><strong>90%</strong> - Ebola is only transmitted through
      direct contact with bodily fluids from an infectious
      person. <i>As long as we remember that those bodily fluids don't
      necessarily have to be in or on the infectious person, I believe
      this statement is true. It doesn't appear that humans aerosolize
      Ebola, but pigs might.</i></li>

    <li><strong>40%</strong> - Somebody who is infected with Ebola,
    but is not showing symptoms, is NOT contagious. <i>I worry quite a
    bit about this because there are no numbers I could find to back
    it up.</i>
    </li>

    <li><strong>0%</strong> - Ebola is up to 90% fatal <i>I believe
    it's actually 57% fatal, with wide variation largely due to
    quality of care, on an outbreak-to-outbreak basis.</i></li>

    <li><strong>90%</strong> - Ebola is not airborne <i>I'm not
    worried about walking outside, but I wouldn't want to be in the
    same room as an Ebola patient without respiratory
    protection</i></li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  I'm not a doctor; all I've done is reviewed a bunch of scientific
  papers and drawn my own conclusions. I'm not trying to instill fear;
  if anything, I hope that by helping readers to get a deeper
  understanding of the science, they can draw their own conclusions.
  The papers are out there; you don't have to take my word for it, and
  you don't have to take politicians' or pundits' words for it,
  either.
